It can be a frustrating part of data science, especially if you're newer to the field and don't have a lot of experience.

On the other hand, if a value is missing because it wasn't recorded, then you can try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row. This is called imputation, and we'll learn how to do it next! :)\n",
